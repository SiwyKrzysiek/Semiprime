# Semiprime numbers
Task from [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/learn/14964/?ref=app)

## Description
A **semiprime number** is a natural number that is the product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.

## Examples
**Input:** 57  
**Output:** `true`  
(57 is a semiprime number because it is the product of two primes, 57 = 3 * 19)

**Input:** 121  
**Output:** `true`  
(121 is a semiprime number because it is the product of two primes, 121 = 11 * 11)

**Input:** 186  
**Output:** `false`  
(186 is not a semiprime number because it is the product of three primes: 186 = 2 * 3 * 31)

## Task
Write a program to check if the user input is a **semiprime number** or not.

## Bonus
Print all the semiprime numbers in a given range.
